    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let name = 'Ak';
    let name1 = name;
    console.log(name);
    console.log(name1);
    name1 = "Aditya";
    console.log(name);
    console.log(name1);
    
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team);
    team[0] = 'Ak';   //This will change the playears array too 
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // Array copy can be made by no. of ways as follows:-
    const t1 = players.slice();
    const t2 = [].concat(players);
    const t3 = [...players];
    const t4 = Array.from(players);
    t1[0] = "z";
    t2[0] = "y";
    t3[0] = "x";
    t4[0] = "w";
    console.log(t1); 
    console.log(t2); 
    console.log(t3); 
    console.log(t4); 


    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const obj = person;     
    obj.name = "Not Wes Bos";   //it will change the original object too as it assign by reference
    console.log(person);
    console.log(obj);
 
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const o2 = Object.assign({}, person);
    o2.name = "wes2";
    console.log(person);
    console.log(o2);
